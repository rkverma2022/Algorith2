A binary tree is a data structure that is defined as a collection of elements called nodes. In a binary tree, the topmost element is called the root node, and each node has 0, 1, or at the most 2 children. A node that has zero children is called a leaf node or a terminal node. Every node contains a data element, a left pointer which points to the left child, and a right pointer which points to the right child.

Every node contains a data element, a left pointer which points to the left child, and a right pointer which points to the right child. The root element is pointed by a 'root' pointer. If root = NULL, then it means the tree is empty.A binary tree is a data structure that is defined as a collection of elements called nodes.
